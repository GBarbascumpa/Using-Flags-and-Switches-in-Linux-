# Using-Flags-and-Switches-in-Linux-
A majority of commands, in Linux, allow for arguments to be provided. These arguments are identified by a hyphen and a certain keyworkd known as flags and swtiches. 
When using a command, unless otherwise specified, it will perform its default behaviour. 
For example "ls" lists the contents of the working directory. However, hidden files are not shown. 
We can use "flags" and "switches" to extend the behavior of commands. 
After using the "-a" argument (short for --all), we now suddenly have an output with a few more files and folders such as ".hiddenfolder". <img width="400" height="347" alt="Linux 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc546b44-498d-4fa8-ae22-fa45b6e7b617" />

The Man(ual) pages are a great source of information for both system commands and applications available on both a Linux machine, which is accessibble on the machine itself and online. 
To access this documentation, we can use the "man" command and then provide the command we want to read the documentation for.
